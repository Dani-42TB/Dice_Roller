This is my first program written in python to put into practice what I have been learning.

So pretty much that, I'm just starting out with programming (for like a year, but now I'm really taking it more serously)
and I'm learning from different resources, right now, I'm auditing MITx: 6.00.1x and it's been one of the most helpfull resources
I have tried. Also I'm just reading the docs, PY4E, and SICP (That last one I havent touched much). And yeah. I've been having a
lot of fun writing [redacted] that doesn't work, lol. But yeah, all jokes aside I'm really enjoying programming, and any tips, code
modifications on this  little project, or even features, are all well recieved. Also, you can do with my code whatever you want.

So yeah. My name is Dani BTW. And when I'm not programming, I'm acting, currently studying at a university here in my country, 
and I'm teaching myself cs, programming and game development (With godot for the engine, Aseprite for the art) on the side.
